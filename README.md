# IMPORTANT UPDATE

**I'm looking for development help**. The project is now outdated with regards to Eclipse version and needs multiple fixes but, unless someone volunteers to help or a I find a decent funding option, I'm not going to spend more time on this: you are free to fork and fix your own specific issue or jump over the boat and collaborate and I will be grateful for reporting issues, but don't expect them being fixed anytime soon.

##### Natural installation can be achieved by adding the `Natural Plugin Update Site` with `http://rlogiacco.github.com/Natural` as URL.

##### Natural is also available on the [Eclipse Marketplace][2] for an easy and seamless installation.
